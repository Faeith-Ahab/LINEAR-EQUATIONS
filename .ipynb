    "What is a linear equation?\n",
    "A linear equation is an algebraic equation of the form y=mx+b. involving only a constant and a first-order (linear) term, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n",
    "The general guideline to follow when solving systems of linear equation word problems is through writing algebraic expressions.\n",
    "1.\tDefine your variables. Since this is a system, there will be two or more variables. Read the problem and identify the unknown quantity. Select variables to represent the unknown quantities \n",
    "2.\tWrite your equations using the given information. Again, since this is a system, there will be two or more equations. \n",
    "3.\tSolve the system. This can be done using the elimination method, substitution method, or graphing.\n",
    "4.\tState your answer. A solution to a system of linear equations is a set of values for the variables which makes all the equations true.\n",

    "Let c be number of children\n",

    "Plug this back into the other equation to solve for a. By isolating one variable in one equation. \n",
